# dionysus-bot
Discord bot to manage my game servers


If you add this to your own server make a discord app and hook it into this code by adding your own discord-auth.json.

Once you have the auth info

    npm run addCommands

Will add commands to your server

    npm run start

Will start the bot


The scripts in the /scripts folder are to get info from or start your servers, they will probably have to be adjusted to your environment
